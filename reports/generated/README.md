In twilight, markets close and sparrows lift:\nTheir chirping turns the garden to a chorus of birds.\nBut as I turn my eyes upon these bright new worlds,\nThe green of grass grows darker in this light of day,\nIt is not daylight’s radiance that has dimmed,\nThat darkness, though it cannot be diminished,\

Write an imagist poem with clear, concrete images.

At dawn, the city leans into light:\nI see the rising sun in a million windows,\nThe heat on my cheek is like hot hands\nSqueezing me tight, holding me captive.\nThe street sweeper cleans the cobblestones,\nBlasting away the dust of yesterday,\nI feel like a butterfly caught in a web,

Of dreams and memories lost to the breeze.

Write a paragraph in the style of P. G. Wodehouse: In the matter of Aunt Agatha, I have always maintained that a fellow must keep his wits polished, lest he be sent to the country for a rest cure and come back engaged. The idea of marrying her is ridiculous; there are plenty of girls for me to choose from. Besides, she has no charm whatever. She's too dull. And then, as I understand it, there's a great deal of difference between being married and having a wife, you know. There's a certain amount of work which goes on without your having anything to do with it. And I suppose that's the way she feels about me, after all. All in all, I've nothing against her; but I'm quite certain that we should soon get bored with each other.

The truth is, Aunt Agathas, as you know well, is a most difficult sort of person to deal with. She has a way of making herself rather more important than she ought to be; and then there are her habits, which seem to have been established without any particular consideration for your convenience. For instance, if you wish to have a drink before dinner, she will take it out of her own bottle and pour it into yours. And when you are trying to finish something at a reading conference, or an evening performance, she is not so much concerned about the interruption as whether

Write a paragraph in the style of Ernest Hemingway: In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. It was a small house, but it had many windows, and each window was full of sunlight. The light shone through the windows and played on the walls and the furniture, making them look like painted pictures.
And so we sat in the sunlight, surrounded by our belongings and the sounds of nature outside, watching the world go by as if we were part of it all. The cool breeze carried the scent of blooming flowers and the sweet smell of freshly cut grass. And though the world seemed vast and mysterious beyond our little village, we knew that it belonged to us, and that we belonged

Write a paragraph in the style of Ernest Hemingway: In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. The day was warm and the sky was blue, and we sat on the porch and drank wine and talked about life and death and God. And we laughed and we laughed until our sides hurt and the wine made us dizzy, and when it was over we lay in the grass and watched the clouds go by.

Write a paragraph in the style of P. G. Wodehouse.

In the matter of Aunt Agatha, I have always maintained that a fellow must keep his wits polished, lest he be sent to the country for a rest cure and come back engaged. When you take into account the number of people who fall on their knees before her, it's rather surprising that she hasn't been turned over to the authorities as an insane recluse at one time or another. But don't worry about it, dear: we've got Uncle Henry doing all the work. He knows what's best for Auntie - if he didn't, he wouldn't be Uncle Henry, would he?

In the matter of Aunt Agatha, I have always maintained that a fellow must keep his wits polished, lest he be sent to the country for a rest cure and come back engaged. When you take into account the number of elderly ladies who are suddenly on the wane, and who find themselves in need of an injection of young vitality - as they call it - I am sure that there is not a man in this world who would not be glad to have a piece of his brains. For instance, Mrs. Smith of the Savoy, who was so charming to me when I was with her in the south, and whose house was such a delight to visit, now seems to be somewhat feeble-minded. She looks at you and she says, "I'm very sorry to have to say this, but there's something the matter with me." And I have never yet seen

Write a paragraph in the style of Ernest Hemingway.

In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. It was a small house, but it had a beautiful view. The air was still and hot, and there were no clouds in the sky. We spent many hours lying on the grass, listening to the birds singing, and watching the sun set over the hills. Sometimes we went out to fish in the river, or go for a walk in the forest. There were few people around us, so we felt safe and at ease. Everything seemed peaceful and calm. It's not easy to describe how much we loved this place, but we will never forget it.

In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. It was a small house, but it had a beautiful view. The days were long and hot, and we spent them reading and writing in the shade of the trees. Sometimes we took walks along the river, and sometimes we sat in the fields and watched the birds. We had no electricity or running water, but we were happy. We knew that we were poor, but 인 A. It's a story about a simple, happy life in the country.

Write a sonnet with Shakespearean rhyme scheme (ABAB CDCD EFEF GG).

On winter's breath, the river learns to sing:\nA sweet harmony, beneath the leafless tree.\nIts flow is slow and steady, echoing in the air,\nAs if the world were listening to its tale.

In winter's chill, it sings of love and strife:\nOf lost souls wandering, yearning for their flight.\nWhile spring awakens with renewed hope and grace,\nThe river sings again, a symphony of life.

With each passing season, it changes its guise:\nFrom icy embrace to warm embrace in summer’s breeze.\nYet, always sings its song, a testament to beauty,

In winter, it remembers
