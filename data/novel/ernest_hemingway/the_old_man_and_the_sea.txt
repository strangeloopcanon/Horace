The Old Man and the Sea (Ernest Hemingway, 1952)
Santiago, an aging Cuban fisherman, has gone 84 days without catching a fish.  Manolin, a boy he taught to fish, now works on another boat but still cares for the old man.  Determined to end his unlucky streak, Santiago sails far into the Gulf Stream.  He hooks a giant marlin and engages in a grueling three‑day struggle, enduring cramps, hunger and exhaustion.  He respects the marlin’s strength and sees it as a worthy adversary.  When he finally harpoons it and lashes it alongside his skiff, sharks attack and devour the fish despite Santiago’s efforts.  He returns with only the skeleton, exhausted but undefeated.  The novella explores themes of perseverance, dignity and the relationship between humans and nature.
