The War of the Worlds (H. G. Wells, 1898)
Cylindrical capsules from Mars land near London, and tripod‑like Martian machines emerge, wielding heat rays and poisonous black smoke.  The narrator witnesses the destruction of towns and the collapse of human society.  Army artillery is powerless against the aliens’ advanced technology.  As refugees flee, the narrator becomes separated from his wife and travels through a devastated landscape, encountering a deranged curate and an embittered artilleryman.  Meanwhile, his brother helps evacuate people by ship across the Channel.  Just as humanity’s defeat seems certain, the Martians succumb to Earth’s bacteria, to which they have no immunity.  The invaders die, their machines collapse, and the narrator reunites with his wife.  Wells’s novel is a pioneering work of science fiction and a commentary on imperialism and human vulnerability.
