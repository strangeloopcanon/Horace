The Picture of Dorian Gray (Oscar Wilde, 1890)
In Victorian London, the artist Basil Hallward paints a portrait of his handsome young friend Dorian Gray.  Influenced by the hedonistic Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian wishes he could remain eternally youthful while the portrait ages in his stead.  His wish comes true: he retains his beauty, but the portrait records the marks of his sins.  Dorian pursues a life of indulgence and cruelty, causing the actress Sybil Vane to commit suicide and corrupting friends.  Years pass while the portrait grows hideous.  Haunted by his conscience, Dorian stabs Basil and blackmails an old friend to dispose of the body.  Finally, tormented by guilt, he slashes the portrait.  Servants hear a cry and discover an aged, withered corpse; the portrait has returned to its original beauty.  Wilde’s novel explores aestheticism, moral decay and the cost of vanity.
