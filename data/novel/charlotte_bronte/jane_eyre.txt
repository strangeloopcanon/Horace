Jane Eyre (Charlotte Brontë, 1847)
Orphaned Jane Eyre endures a harsh childhood with her cruel aunt Reed and the bleak Lowood School.  As a young woman she becomes governess to Adèle at Thornfield Hall, the estate of the enigmatic Mr. Rochester.  Jane and Rochester develop a deep bond, but on their wedding day she discovers that he is already married to Bertha Mason, a madwoman confined in Thornfield’s attic.  Devastated, Jane leaves and nearly dies on the moors.  She is taken in by clergyman St. John Rivers and his sisters, who are unbeknownst to her cousins.  St. John proposes a loveless marriage as missionaries, but Jane hears Rochester calling her in a mystic vision.  She returns to Thornfield to find it burned by Bertha, who perished in the fire.  Rochester, maimed and blind, reunites with Jane, and they marry.  Brontë’s novel blends romance, gothic mystery and a heroine’s search for independence.
