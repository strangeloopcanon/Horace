Dracula (Bram Stoker, 1897)
Solicitor Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to assist the mysterious Count Dracula with a real estate transaction.  He discovers Dracula is a vampire planning to move to England and feed on new victims.  Harker escapes the castle and returns to England, where Dracula preys upon Lucy Westenra, a friend of Harker’s fiancée Mina Murray.  Despite blood transfusions from her suitors, Lucy dies and becomes undead.  Professor Abraham Van Helsing leads Harker, Mina and Lucy’s suitors in a campaign to destroy Dracula.  They track the Count back to Transylvania, where they kill him with a knife and decapitation.  Mina, nearly corrupted, is saved.  Stoker’s epistolary novel blends Gothic horror with modern technologies such as telegrams and typewriters, and established many conventions of vampire fiction.
