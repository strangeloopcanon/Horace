Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (Mary Shelley, 1818)
Victor Frankenstein, a young Swiss scientist, becomes obsessed with creating life.  At university in Ingolstadt he assembles a body from cadavers and animates it.  Horrified by his creation’s monstrous appearance, he abandons it.  The creature, rejected by all, educates himself in secret and yearns for companionship.  Shunned and mistreated, he becomes vengeful and murders Victor’s brother.  The creature confronts Victor, recounts his suffering, and demands a female mate.  Victor begins to make one but destroys it, fearing a race of monsters.  In revenge the creature kills Victor’s friend and bride.  Victor pursues him to the Arctic, where he dies.  The creature, remorseful, vows to end his own life.  Shelley’s novel raises questions about scientific responsibility and the consequences of playing God.
