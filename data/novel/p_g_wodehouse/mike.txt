Mike (P. G. Wodehouse, 1909)
Mike Jackson, a gifted cricket batsman, is sent from Wrykyn School to the more prestigious Sedleigh after getting into trouble.  Devastated to leave his beloved cricket team, Mike finds Sedleigh dull until he meets the eccentric Rupert Psmith.  Tall, monocled and loquacious, Psmith befriends Mike and liven ups the school.  Though denied the chance to play for the Sedleigh eleven, Mike continues to practice, and his talent is recognized.  The novel blends school story with humour and introduces Psmith, who would become one of Wodehouse’s most beloved characters.
