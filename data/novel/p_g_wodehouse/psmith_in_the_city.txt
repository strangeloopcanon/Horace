Psmith in the City (P. G. Wodehouse, 1910)
Following the events of Mike, Mike Jackson’s cricket career is interrupted when his father suffers financial losses.  Mike must work at the New Asiatic Bank in London instead of returning to school.  His friend Psmith, having tired of Cambridge, also takes a position there.  The two young men chafe under the bank’s petty bureaucracy and conspire to subvert it.  Psmith’s charm and audacity rescue Mike from dismissal more than once.  The novel satirizes office life while celebrating friendship and cricket; it also shows Psmith at his most flamboyant, exchanging barbs with superiors and organizing a cricket match to win back their independence.
