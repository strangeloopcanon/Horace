The Pothunters (P. G. Wodehouse, 1902)
This early novel, set at the fictional English public school St. Austin’s, follows various pupils through a lively term.  The school’s prized sports trophies—silver pots for cricket and rugby—are stolen from the pavilion, causing a stir.  Amateur detectives among the boys, including the energetic Psmith prototype Mike Jackson, search for clues while balancing lessons, pranks and games.  The story culminates in the recovery of the trophies and a thrilling cricket match.  Wodehouse’s first book introduces themes that recur in his later school stories: camaraderie, sporting spirit and gentle satire of authority.
