Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen, 1813)
The Bennet family has five daughters of marriageable age and little fortune.  When the wealthy bachelor Mr. Bingley rents nearby Netherfield, Mrs. Bennet hopes he will marry one of her girls.  Bingley is attracted to the eldest, Jane, while his proud friend Mr. Darcy clashes with the spirited second daughter, Elizabeth.  Darcy initially dismisses the Bennets as socially inferior but grows to admire Elizabeth’s wit and integrity.  Elizabeth dislikes Darcy after hearing that he separated Bingley from Jane and believing he wronged the charming militia officer Wickham.  Over time she learns of Darcy’s true character and his generosity, while he overcomes his pride.  After misunderstandings and Lydia Bennet’s scandalous elopement, Darcy and Elizabeth acknowledge their love and marry.  Austen’s novel satirizes class and manners while presenting one of literature’s great romances.
