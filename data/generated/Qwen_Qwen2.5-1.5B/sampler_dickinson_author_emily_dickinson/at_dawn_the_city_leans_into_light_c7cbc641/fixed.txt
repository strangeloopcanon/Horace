Write a poem in the style of Emily Dickinson.

At dawn, the city leans into light:
A quiet whisper, not a sound,
The stars are still, and stars are bright,
And I'm afraid to move my sight.

I stand alone upon the wall,
Where shadows dance, and voices fall,
I look down at leaves that rustle,
And see them dance, like birds in flight.

Oh, how I wish to be beside
The river's flow, where life is free,
To float on currents evermore,
And breathe the air, without a care.

But here I am, alone again,
With thoughts that race like horses fast,
And fears that hide behind my eyes,
And doubts that whisper, "Why must I grieve?"

Yet I will keep my faith and trust,
For hope is there, and love is true,
And though the world may seem so wild,
I know it all, and more than ever.
