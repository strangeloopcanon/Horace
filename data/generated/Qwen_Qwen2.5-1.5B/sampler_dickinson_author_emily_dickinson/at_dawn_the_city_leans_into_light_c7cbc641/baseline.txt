Write a poem in the style of Emily Dickinson.

At dawn, the city leans into light:
A painted skyline emerges from night.
The wind whispers secrets through the trees,
While shadows stretch, like fingers weeping.

In fields where daisies bloom and sway,
The scent of summer fills the air.
A bird soars high above the meadow's edge,
Its song is pure and free as thought.

In kitchens bright with morning's glow,
Dishes shine under the morning sun.
Fathers' hands knead dough and kneel,
Their faces stern yet tenderly good.

Children laugh and run, their laughter loud,
Through streets that dance with children's joy.
They chase each other around the block,
Their hearts filled with hope and unconfined.

Evening falls, and shadows lengthen,
The world is still when stars appear.
But even in this quiet solitude,
There's something at my heart to say.
