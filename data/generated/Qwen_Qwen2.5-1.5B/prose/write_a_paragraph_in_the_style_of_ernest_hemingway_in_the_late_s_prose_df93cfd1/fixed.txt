Write a paragraph in the style of Ernest Hemingway: In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. The day was warm and the sky was blue, and we sat on the porch and drank wine and talked about life and death and God. And we laughed and we laughed until our sides hurt and the wine made us dizzy, and when it was over we lay in the grass and watched the clouds go by.
