Write a paragraph in the style of P. G. Wodehouse.

In the matter of Aunt Agatha, I have always maintained that a fellow must keep his wits polished, lest he be sent to the country for a rest cure and come back engaged. When you take into account the number of people who fall on their knees before her, it's rather surprising that she hasn't been turned over to the authorities as an insane recluse at one time or another. But don't worry about it, dear: we've got Uncle Henry doing all the work. He knows what's best for Auntie - if he didn't, he wouldn't be Uncle Henry, would he?
