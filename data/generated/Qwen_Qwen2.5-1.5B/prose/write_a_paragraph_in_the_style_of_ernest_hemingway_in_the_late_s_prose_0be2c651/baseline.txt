Write a paragraph in the style of Ernest Hemingway.

In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. It was a small house, but it had a beautiful view. The air was still and hot, and there were no clouds in the sky. We spent many hours lying on the grass, listening to the birds singing, and watching the sun set over the hills. Sometimes we went out to fish in the river, or go for a walk in the forest. There were few people around us, so we felt safe and at ease. Everything seemed peaceful and calm. It's not easy to describe how much we loved this place, but we will never forget it.
