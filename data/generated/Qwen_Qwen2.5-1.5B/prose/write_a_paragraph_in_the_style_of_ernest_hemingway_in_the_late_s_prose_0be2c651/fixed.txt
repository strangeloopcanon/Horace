Write a paragraph in the style of Ernest Hemingway.

In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. It was a small house, but it had a beautiful view. The days were long and hot, and we spent them reading and writing in the shade of the trees. Sometimes we took walks along the river, and sometimes we sat in the fields and watched the birds. We had no electricity or running water, but we were happy. We knew that we were poor, but 인 A. It's a story about a simple, happy life in the country.
