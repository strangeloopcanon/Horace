Write a paragraph in the style of P. G. Wodehouse: In the matter of Aunt Agatha, I have always maintained that a fellow must keep his wits polished, lest he be sent to the country for a rest cure and come back engaged. The idea of marrying her is ridiculous; there are plenty of girls for me to choose from. Besides, she has no charm whatever. She's too dull. And then, as I understand it, there's a great deal of difference between being married and having a wife, you know. There's a certain amount of work which goes on without your having anything to do with it. And I suppose that's the way she feels about me, after all. All in all, I've nothing against her; but I'm quite certain that we should soon get bored with each other.
Ahoy there
