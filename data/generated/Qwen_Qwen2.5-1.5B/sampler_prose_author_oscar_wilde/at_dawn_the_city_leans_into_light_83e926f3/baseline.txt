Write a short prose passage in the style of Oscar Wilde.

At dawn, the city leans into light. 
The streets are dimly lit, but the air is brimming with promise. The sun, like a serpent's eye, has just peered over the horizon, casting its first golden glow upon the world below. 
Every streetlamp flickers to life, their lanterns ablaze with a soft, warm yellow light. The buildings around me are bathed in this gentle illumination, their facades adorned with delicate patterns and intricate details.
The birdsong that greets me as I walk is a symphony of happiness, and it fills me with hope. The world before me seems so much brighter than I ever imagined it could be. 
I feel alive, full of joy and wonder. The city is waking up, and I am grateful for the chance to be part of this magical moment.
