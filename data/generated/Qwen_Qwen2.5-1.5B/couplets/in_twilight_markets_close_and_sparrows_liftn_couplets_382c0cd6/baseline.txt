In twilight, markets close and sparrows lift:\nTheir chirping turns the garden to a chorus of birds.\nBut as I turn my eyes upon these bright new worlds,\nThe green of grass grows darker in this light of day,\nIt is not daylight’s radiance that has dimmed,\nThat darkness, though it cannot be diminished,\
