At dawn, the city leans into light:
The morning is golden, a gentle
wave of light. It bathes the city in its warm glow,
the sun’s golden rays caress and soothe us,
and our tired bones stretch long and wide.
The city comes to life, waking up
from a deep sleep. The streets are alive with
a buzzing noise, the sound of people
coming together to greet the new day.
A woman walks her dog, children play on the playground,
parents talk with their children, couples stroll
in the park. The city is a vibrant
landscape of human activity, a bustling
market
