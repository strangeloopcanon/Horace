At dawn, the city leans into light:
The sun is a bright and smiling face.
The morning sky is like a big bed of flowers;
In the distance, a flock of white birds are flying high.
In the city, the streetlights are dimmed,
As if they're sleeping quietly under the night sky.
A river of water flows slowly,
Like a gentle stream in the morning breeze.
A group of children come running to me,
With smiles on their faces, they play happily.
Their laughter fills the air,
Making everyone's heart feel warm and bright.
A family pet barks excitedly,
Making the whole neighborhood sound lively.
