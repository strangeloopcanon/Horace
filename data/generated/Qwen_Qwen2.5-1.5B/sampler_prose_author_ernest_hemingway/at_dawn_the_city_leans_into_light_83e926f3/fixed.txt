Write a short prose passage in the style of Ernest Hemingway.

At dawn, the city leans into light. 
The air is crisp and clean, dusted with dew. 
In the distance, the horizon stretches out like a tapestry of blue. 
I walk along the street, my feet sinking slightly into the pavement. 
A lone figure passes by, their silhouette outlined against the sky. 
As I turn a corner, I spot a small dog trotting towards me. It barks at me, its fur bristling. 
With a start, I realize that it's a stray cat. Its eyes are bright and curious, reflecting the morning sun. 
Without thinking, I reach out and gently stroke its head. The cat arches its back, purring softly. 
It's a simple gesture, but it feels right. As we stand there, side by side, the world around us fades away.
