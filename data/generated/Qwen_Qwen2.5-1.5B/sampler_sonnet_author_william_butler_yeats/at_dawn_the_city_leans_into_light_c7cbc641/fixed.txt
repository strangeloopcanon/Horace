Write a Shakespearean sonnet in the style of William Butler Yeats.

At dawn, the city leans into light:
The spires and towers, like specters, quiver,
As if to greet the morning's gentlest kiss.
The world awakens from its slumber deep,
And shadows flee before the sun's embrace.

In this new day, the earth is bathed in gold,
And life is filled with music and song.
The birds sing sweetly, their melodies so bold,
As they take flight, leaving behind the night.

The city stands tall, a beacon of hope,
Its streets bustling with people on their way.
They walk with purpose, each step forward bold,
Their laughter echoing through the air.

The clouds part, revealing clear blue skies,
And the wind whispers secrets to the breeze.
It carries tales of love and joy afar,
And brings the promise of a brighter day.

So let us bid farewell to yesterday,
And embrace the wonders that await us anew.
For in this moment, we find our place,
Within the heart of the universe.
