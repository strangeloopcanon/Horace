Write a Shakespearean sonnet in the style of William Butler Yeats.

At dawn, the city leans into light:
A tapestry of shadows and glimmer.
The silken threads of buildings weep,
And the city weeps with a silver tear.
In its heart, where whispers of time entwine,
We find solace and loss intertwined.
Yet the soul of the city remains untold,
A mystery hidden beneath its guise.
For like a dream, it floats on the night's tide,
Leaving behind echoes of a lost rhyme.
