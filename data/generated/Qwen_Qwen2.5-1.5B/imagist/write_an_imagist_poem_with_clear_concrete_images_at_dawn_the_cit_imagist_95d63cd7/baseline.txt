Write an imagist poem with clear, concrete images.

At dawn, the city leans into light:\nI see the rising sun in a million windows,\nThe heat on my cheek is like hot hands\nSqueezing me tight, holding me captive.\nThe street sweeper cleans the cobblestones,\nBlasting away the dust of yesterday,\nI feel like a butterfly caught in a web,

Of dreams and memories lost to the breeze.
