Write an imagist poem with clear, concrete images.

At dawn, the city leans into light:\nI see the rising sun in pinks and oranges,\nIts warmth radiates through the streets,\nAnd birds sing their melodious songs.\nA warm breeze stirs the leaves,\nSending waves of fragrance into the air,\nAs I watch, the world begins to awake,\nIn a world of chaos and beauty.
