Write a sonnet with Shakespearean rhyme scheme (ABAB CDCD EFEF GG).

On winter's breath, the river learns to sing:\nA sweet harmony, beneath the snow\nThat laments the dying of the day\nAs it retreats, into its deep abode\nWhere all life's hopes and dreams have passed away\nAnd the world is once again reborn\nWith new beginnings and a fresh start\nThat makes me wonder, what lies ahead\nOf what we've come to know and seen\nAnd what we'll endure, in time's great grandeur\nAs we traverse the path of life
