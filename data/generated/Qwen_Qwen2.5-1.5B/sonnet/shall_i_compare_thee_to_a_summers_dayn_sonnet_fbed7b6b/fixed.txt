Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nI will compare thee\na summer's morning when the roses bloom.\nA summer's night, where stars do twinkle bright,\na summer's noon, with a cool breeze in your hair,\nA sunny afternoon spent under the trees,\nor a quiet evening by the fire.\nFor every season has its own charm,\nso why not compare me to a day?\nThe sun will set
