Write a poem in the style of Alfred Lord Tennyson.

At dawn, the monkey leans into light:
The sun is rising on the mountain's height.
The river sings with crystal-clear stream,
And birds are singing in their morning flight.

The fields are green and golden, as the wind
Bears whispers from the valley to the hill.
The orchids bloom with every breeze that blows,
And the sweet scent of jasmine is so low.

The old man sits by the fire, his face
A map of years, both joy and grief.
He tells of distant lands and tales,
Of heroes' deeds and shadows of the past.

The child walks barefoot through the dew,
His laughter ringing through
