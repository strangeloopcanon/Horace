Write a poem in the style of Alfred Lord Tennyson.

At dawn, the monkey leans into light:
The morning's first breath, a whispering tide,
The world awakes with boughs and bird,
A soft, golden hue that paints the skies.

In fields of emerald, life expands,
The sunbeams dance upon the grass,
Each leaf a hymn to time's embrace,
As nature sings her ancient psalm.

But oh, the heart, it beats with thought,
A symphony of joy and sorrow,
Where dreams are born and ghosts are cast,
And love, like fire, burns bright.

Yet still, the soul is bound by pain,
The weight of years,
