The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Robert Louis Stevenson, 1886)
In London, lawyer Gabriel Utterson investigates the strange connection between his respectable friend Dr. Henry Jekyll and the violent, debased Mr. Edward Hyde.  A series of brutal incidents convince Utterson that Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll.  When Hyde murders Sir Danvers Carew, a member of Parliament, he disappears, and Jekyll seems relieved.  But months later Jekyll isolates himself.  After Utterson and Jekyll’s servants break into his laboratory, they find Hyde’s body wearing Jekyll’s clothes and a letter explaining the truth.  Jekyll created a potion that separated his good and evil natures, allowing him to indulge his darker side as Hyde.  Over time Hyde grew stronger and uncontrollable, forcing Jekyll to take his own life.  The novella explores duality and the danger of unchecked desires.
