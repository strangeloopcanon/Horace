After Twenty Years (O. Henry, 1906)
On a dark New York street, a policeman on patrol encounters a man waiting in a doorway.  The stranger explains that he is meeting his best friend from youth; they agreed twenty years earlier to reunite at this spot.  He proudly tells of his success out West.  The officer wishes him well and departs.  Later another man approaches, and the friends greet each other warmly.  They walk arm in arm discussing their lives.  Under a streetlight the visitor realizes this is not the policeman he met earlier but a plainclothes detective.  The detective hands him a note: the first officer was his old friend, now a policeman, who recognized him as a wanted criminal but could not bring himself to arrest him personally.  Duty and loyalty collide in this twist ending typical of O. Henry.
