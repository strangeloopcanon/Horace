Bartleby, the Scrivener (Herman Melville, 1853)
The unnamed narrator, a Wall Street lawyer, hires Bartleby to copy legal documents alongside his other clerks Turkey and Nippers.  At first Bartleby works diligently, but he soon begins responding to requests with the mild refusal "I would prefer not to."  He stops proof‑reading, then refuses to copy altogether.  Rather than dismiss him, the narrator tolerates Bartleby, who eventually moves into the office.  When the lawyer relocates to rid himself of the problem, Bartleby stays in the old office until he is removed as a vagrant and imprisoned.  The narrator visits him in jail, only to find him sitting forlornly by a wall, preferring not to eat.  Bartleby dies of starvation.  The story satirizes the dehumanizing nature of modern work and the limits of charity, leaving readers to ponder Bartleby’s quiet rebellion and isolation.
