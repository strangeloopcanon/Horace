Benito Cereno (Herman Melville, 1855)
Captain Amasa Delano of the American sealer Bachelor’s Delight encounters a seemingly distressed Spanish slave ship, the San Dominick, off the coast of Chile.  Its captain, Benito Cereno, appears ill and his crew listless.  Slaves mill freely on deck, and Delano notices strange behavior, but his trusting nature prevents him from suspecting danger.  He offers assistance and supplies.  Gradually he senses a threat but is repeatedly reassured by Cereno and his servant, Babo.  Only when Babo’s dagger flashes does Delano realize that the slaves have mutinied and that Cereno is their captive.  Delano and his men overpower the rebels and escort the ship to port.  In court, Cereno’s deposition reveals the brutality of the revolt and his own trauma.  The story probes themes of slavery, deception and moral complicity.
