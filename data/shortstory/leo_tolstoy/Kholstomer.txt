Kholstomer: The Story of a Horse (Leo Tolstoy, 1886)
The narrative is told from the perspective of a piebald gelding named Kholstomer.  Considered ugly because of his mottled coat, he is used as a workhorse despite his noble pedigree.  He reflects on human folly, noting that people judge by appearances and claim ownership of land and animals.  Kholstomer serves various masters, including a nobleman who wastes his life and property.  Eventually the old horse collapses and is sold for meat.  As he is slaughtered, he observes that his flesh will feed peasants and dogs.  Tolstoy juxtaposes the horse’s dignity and endurance with human vanity, illustrating moral and social critiques through an animal’s eyes.
