How Much Land Does a Man Need? (Leo Tolstoy, 1886)
Pahom, a peasant who envies landowners, complains that if he had enough land he would fear nothing.  The Devil overhears and decides to tempt him.  Pahom buys land but remains dissatisfied and quarrels with neighbours.  He hears of the Bashkirs, who will sell all the land he can walk around in a day for a thousand rubles.  At dawn he begins circling a vast tract, marking his path with a spade.  Driven by greed, he walks farther than he should.  Exhausted and sun‑struck, he races back to his starting point, arriving at sunset and collapsing dead.  His servant buries him in a six‑foot grave—"six feet from his head to his heels was all he needed."  Tolstoy’s parable condemns avarice and the illusion that more land brings security.
