Paul’s Case (Willa Cather, 1905)
Paul, a sensitive high‑school student in Pittsburgh, is bored by his middle‑class environment and dreams of art and luxury.  His teachers view him as insolent and he is suspended for his theatrical mannerisms.  He finds refuge as an usher at Carnegie Hall, where he admires the performers and the opulent setting.  Desperate to escape his dull life and domineering father, he steals money from his employer and runs away to New York City.  There he spends lavishly on clothes, food and a suite at the Waldorf.  For a few days he lives the aesthetic life he longed for, but the theft is soon discovered.  Facing disgrace and the return to his former life, Paul throws himself in front of an oncoming train.  The story explores alienation, art and the gulf between dreams and reality.
