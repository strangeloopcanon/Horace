The Yellow Wallpaper (Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 1892)
A young woman suffers from what her physician husband calls a "temporary nervous depression" after the birth of their child.  As a cure, he rents a colonial mansion for the summer and confines her to an upstairs nursery with peeling yellow wallpaper.  Forbidden to work or write, she pours her thoughts into a secret journal and becomes obsessed with the wallpaper’s sickly pattern.  As the weeks pass she sees a woman trapped behind the paper and believes she must free her.  At last she tears at the walls and crawls around the room, declaring she is the woman who was trapped.  Her descent into madness is a critique of the oppressive "rest cure" prescribed to women and the stifling domestic roles of the 19th century.
