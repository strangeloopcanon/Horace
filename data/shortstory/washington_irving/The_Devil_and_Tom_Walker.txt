The Devil and Tom Walker (Washington Irving, 1824)
In colonial Massachusetts a miserly man named Tom Walker lives with his equally greedy wife.  One day Tom encounters a black woodsman in a swamp who reveals himself as Old Scratch, the Devil, and offers Tom a bargain: buried treasure in exchange for Tom’s soul.  Tom refuses at first, but after his wife disappears while attempting to strike her own bargain, he agrees.  He becomes a rich usurer, lending money at exorbitant interest rates and foreclosing without mercy.  As he grows old he begins to worry about the afterlife and carries a Bible to protect himself.  One day the Devil arrives on horseback and takes Tom away.  His wealth turns to cinders and his house burns down.  Irving’s story warns that greed and moral corruption lead to damnation.
