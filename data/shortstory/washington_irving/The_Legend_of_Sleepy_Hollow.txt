The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (Washington Irving, 1820)
Schoolteacher Ichabod Crane comes to the quiet village of Sleepy Hollow, known for its ghostly legends.  Ichabod courts the wealthy Katrina Van Tassel, much to the annoyance of local hero Brom Bones.  At a harvest party at the Van Tassel farm, Brom tells scary stories, including that of the Headless Horseman, a Hessian soldier whose head was blown off by a cannonball.  Riding home through the dark woods, Ichabod encounters a cloaked rider who pursues him.  In terror Ichabod races toward the bridge where the ghost is said to vanish.  The rider hurls his head at Ichabod, knocking him off his horse.  The next day, Ichabod has disappeared, leaving only his hat and a shattered pumpkin.  Brom later marries Katrina, and some suspect he played the Horseman to scare away his rival.
