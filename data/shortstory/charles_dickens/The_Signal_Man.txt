The Signal‑Man (Charles Dickens, 1866)
A traveller meets a lonely railway signalman who works in a cutting near a tunnel.  The signalman confesses that he has been haunted by a ghostly figure appearing near the tunnel mouth, always preceding a tragedy on the line.  The first apparition was followed by a terrible collision; the second by the death of a young bride on a train.  Now the spectre has returned, covering its face and waving in warning.  The traveller tries to reassure him, but the signalman remains fearful.  Returning a few days later, the traveller finds a crowd gathered: the signalman has been struck and killed by a passing train.  Witnesses describe the driver of the train waving frantically and shouting, just as the ghost had.  The story suggests that foreknowledge of fate offers no protection.
