The Outcasts of Poker Flat (Bret Harte, 1869)
In a California mining town during the Gold Rush, a committee decides to purge undesirable elements from Poker Flat.  Professional gambler John Oakhurst, the Duchess and Mother Shipton (two prostitutes), and Uncle Billy (a thief) are banished.  As they travel toward the next settlement they meet Tom Simson and his fiancée Piney Woods, who are eloping.  The party camps in a remote cabin but becomes snowbound by a blizzard.  Supplies dwindle and tensions rise.  Uncle Billy steals the mules and leaves.  Mother Shipton starves herself to save provisions for Piney.  Oakhurst fashions snowshoes and sends Tom for help.  The Duchess and Piney freeze to death in each other’s arms.  When rescuers finally arrive, they find Oakhurst dead under a pine tree, having shot himself after nailing a deuce of clubs to the trunk as his epitaph.
