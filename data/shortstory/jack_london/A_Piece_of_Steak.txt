A Piece of Steak (Jack London, 1909)
Tom King, an ageing Australian heavyweight boxer, once fought at the top of his game but now lives in poverty with his family.  On the day of his comeback match against a younger fighter named Sandel, Tom cannot afford a nourishing steak and must fight on an empty stomach.  In the ring, his experience allows him to hold off the younger man, but as the rounds progress his stamina wanes.  He longs for a piece of steak to give him strength.  Ultimately Sandel’s youth prevails and Tom is knocked out.  Paid little for the bout, Tom returns home hungry.  The story captures the harsh realities of working‑class life, the inexorable decline of strength with age, and the dignity of a fighter facing defeat.
