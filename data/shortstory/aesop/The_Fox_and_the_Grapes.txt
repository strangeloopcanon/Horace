# The Fox and the Grapes
**Aesop (traditional)**

A Fox, wandering in a vineyard, saw some clusters of ripe grapes hanging high. He longed to get at them, but they were just out of reach. After many futile leaps, he walked away, saying, “They are sour, and not worth eating.”
**Moral:** It is easy to despise what you cannot get.
