# The North Wind and the Sun
**Aesop (traditional)**

The North Wind and the Sun disputed who was stronger. They agreed that he who could make a traveler take off his cloak should be the victor. The Wind blew; the traveler wrapped his cloak tighter. The Sun shone warmly; the traveler removed it.
**Moral:** Persuasion is stronger than force.
