# The Boy Who Cried Wolf
**Aesop (traditional)**

A Shepherd Boy, to amuse himself, cried “Wolf!” when there was none. The villagers came running and found no wolf. He played the trick again. When a real Wolf came, he cried out and no one believed him; the Wolf ravaged the flock.
**Moral:** Even when liars tell the truth, they are not believed.
