Katherine Mansfield's 1922 story "The Garden Party" follows the affluent Sheridan family on the day of one of Mrs. Sheridan's meticulously planned garden parties.  Laura, one of the daughters, feels elated as she helps decorate the marquee and arrange flowers, imagining herself suddenly very grown‑up.  Mid‑morning, news arrives that a labourer who lived in the cottages down the lane has been killed when his horse bolted.  Laura is shaken; she thinks they should cancel the party out of respect, but her mother and the caterers insist that "people like that" do not expect consideration from her class.  The party goes ahead, a show of wealth and gaiety with food, music and elegant guests, but Laura remains uneasy.  After the party her mother suggests she take a basket of leftovers to the dead man's family.  Laura walks down to the cottages, slipping from the Sheridans' cultivated garden into the rough world of the working poor.  In a dim room she sees the body of the young man, peaceful in death.  The sight overwhelms her with pity and wonder; she is moved by the beauty of his face and the stillness of death.  Disturbed, Laura hurries home; when her brother Laurie meets her she tries to articulate what she has felt, saying "Isn't life…" but she cannot finish the thought.  Laurie comforts her, and the story ends with the siblings united in their unspoken awareness of the gap between their sheltered life and the harshness beyond it.
