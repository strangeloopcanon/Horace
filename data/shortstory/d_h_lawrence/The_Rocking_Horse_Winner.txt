The Rocking‑Horse Winner (D. H. Lawrence, 1926)
A middle‑class English family is plagued by a sense that money is never enough.  The mother feels she has bad luck and cannot love her children.  Her young son Paul becomes obsessed with luck and winning money to please her.  Riding his wooden rocking horse into a trance, he divines the names of winning racehorses.  Secretly aided by his uncle and the gardener Bassett, Paul bets on the races and accumulates a small fortune.  They give his mother a thousand pounds for her birthday, but her greed only intensifies.  Determined to make a final big win, Paul rides the rocking horse feverishly until he collapses with brain fever, having whispered the name of the Derby winner.  The horse wins, but Paul dies that night.  His quest for luck reveals the destructive power of materialism.
