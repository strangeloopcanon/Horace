The Country of the Blind (H. G. Wells, 1904)
While climbing in the Andes, mountaineer Nunez slips and falls into a hidden valley isolated for centuries.  The inhabitants have been blind for generations and constructed a society without sight.  Nunez believes his sight will make him king.  However, the villagers view him as defective and insane, dismissing his talk of "sight".  He falls in love with a young woman but cannot convince the elders to let him marry unless he allows them to remove his eyes.  Terrified, he escapes into the mountains.  Looking back, he sees the peaceful valley and wonders whether leaving was wise.  The story explores cultural relativism and the idea that perception shapes reality.
