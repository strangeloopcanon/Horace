The Magic Shop (H. G. Wells, 1903)
A father takes his young son Gip to a magic shop in London.  Inside, they encounter a proprietor who demonstrates astonishing tricks: a glass ball that shows living figures, eggs that hatch fairies, and mirrors that reflect other worlds.  The father is unsettled as the demonstrations become increasingly uncanny—cards transform into birds and a miniature man appears.  He worries about payment, but the proprietor assures him that everything is genuine magic.  When the father and son finally leave with a box of toys, the shop has vanished from the street.  At home, the son excitedly plays with the seemingly ordinary toys, while the father wonders whether the shop was a dream.  The story blurs the line between childhood wonder and adult skepticism.
