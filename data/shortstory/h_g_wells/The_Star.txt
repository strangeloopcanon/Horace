The Star (H. G. Wells, 1897)
Astronomers observe that a planet has been dislodged from its orbit and is heading toward the solar system.  As it approaches, scientists warn of its possible collision with Earth.  The world watches with dread.  Religious fanatics predict the end times while others profit from the panic.  The newcomer grazes Jupiter, altering its trajectory.  It narrowly misses Earth but causes massive tides and earthquakes.  Humanity survives, but on the planet Mars, astronomers note with regret that a tiny planet—Earth—has been devastated by a near miss with a comet.  Wells’s tale emphasizes humanity’s insignificance in the cosmos and critiques human self‑importance.
