The Birthmark (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1843)
Aylmer, a gifted but obsessive scientist, loves his beautiful wife Georgiana but is fixated on a small crimson birthmark shaped like a hand on her cheek.  Believing it mars her otherwise perfect beauty, he persuades her to let him remove it through science.  In his laboratory, assisted by the earthy Aminadab, Aylmer concocts elixirs and shows Georgiana his past experiments, which often failed.  Georgiana, trusting and eager to please, drinks his final potion.  As she sleeps, the birthmark gradually fades.  Aylmer rejoices, but Georgiana awakens only to tell him that she is dying.  In erasing the tiny flaw, Aylmer has tampered with nature and destroyed the life he cherished.  Hawthorne’s story warns against the pursuit of perfection and the hubris of science over nature.
