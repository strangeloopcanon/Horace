The Minister’s Black Veil (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1832)
In a small New England town, Reverend Mr. Hooper shocks his congregation by appearing at Sunday service with his face covered by a black crape veil.  Though his sermon on secret sin is powerful, the parishioners whisper and speculate that his veil hides some guilt.  Hooper refuses to remove it, even when his fiancée Elizabeth pleads with him, and she leaves him because she cannot face life with a veiled husband.  Over the years he becomes a revered but solitary figure, always symbolizing hidden iniquity.  On his deathbed the other ministers attempt to lift the veil, but he clutches it fiercely, declaring that every person wears a black veil of secret sin before God.  He dies still veiled, leaving the townspeople to reflect on their own concealed transgressions.
