Mrs. Bathurst (Rudyard Kipling, 1901)
In a railway yard in South Africa, three men—Sergeant Pritchard, Hooper, and the narrator—talk with a retired seaman named Mr. Vickery.  Pritchard mentions Mrs. Bathurst, a warm, generous widow who kept a hotel in New Zealand and was admired by sailors.  She was particularly kind to a naval warrant officer named Vickery.  Later Hooper describes seeing a film in Cape Town showing a London street; among the passers‑by was Mrs. Bathurst walking toward the camera with a look of searching recognition.  The warrant officer, who had deserted his ship, watched the film obsessively.  Soon afterward, two charred bodies are found beside a railway line, one identified by a tattoo.  The story, told through fragments and gossip, hints that Vickery was consumed by his longing for Mrs. Bathurst and met a tragic end.
