"Rikki‑Tikki‑Tavi" comes from Rudyard Kipling’s *Jungle Book* (1894).  The story introduces Rikki‑Tikki, a young mongoose washed by a monsoon flood from his burrow into the garden of an English family living in colonial India.  Teddy, the family's son, rescues him, and the little animal quickly makes himself at home, patrolling the garden like a soldier.  Rikki‑Tikki learns that the bungalow is terrorised by a pair of cobras, Nag and Nagaina, who plan to kill the humans so they can rule the garden.  Following the instinct of a mongoose to fight snakes, Rikki‑Tikki defends his adoptive family.  He kills a small but deadly snake called Karait that threatens Teddy, then watches Nag slip into the bathroom to attack the sleeping man of the house.  Rikki‑Tikki attacks the cobra, clings to his head and refuses to let go while the man shoots Nag dead.  The next day the mongoose discovers Nagaina guarding her nest of eggs.  He destroys most of the eggs, but one remains; he uses it to lure the furious cobra away from the veranda where she is poised to strike Teddy.  When she chases him into her tunnel, he follows her deep into the snake's den and kills her after a desperate underground battle.  Emerging triumphant, Rikki‑Tikki keeps the garden free of snakes forever, earning the eternal gratitude of the family and their household creatures.
