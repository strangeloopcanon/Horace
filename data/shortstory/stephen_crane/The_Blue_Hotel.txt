The Blue Hotel (Stephen Crane, 1899)
Scully, the owner of the Blue Hotel in the town of Fort Romper, Nebraska, takes in three guests: a Swede, a cowboy, and a gambler.  Inside, the Swede becomes paranoid that the others plan to kill him.  The men play cards and the Swede accuses the cowboy of cheating.  A fight ensues and the Swede is beaten.  Humiliated, he leaves the hotel and wanders through town.  Drunk and emboldened, he enters a saloon, bragging about beating the cowboy.  There he insults a quiet gambler, who fatally stabs him.  Later, Scully’s son admits that the Swede was right about cheating in the card game.  The story reveals how misperceptions, cowardice and group guilt contribute to tragedy.
