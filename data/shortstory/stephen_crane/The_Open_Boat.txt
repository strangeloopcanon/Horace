The Open Boat (Stephen Crane, 1897)
After their ship sinks off the coast of Florida, four men—a correspondent, an oiler named Billie, a cook, and the captain—struggle to survive in a small dinghy on rough seas.  They take turns rowing and bailing water.  For days they are buffeted by waves, their hopes rising and falling with the sight of distant lights.  They attempt to land on the shore but are driven back by breakers.  Finally, they decide to risk swimming through the surf.  Exhausted, they jump overboard and make for shore.  The correspondent and the cook reach land with the help of locals.  The captain is dragged to safety.  The oiler, the strongest rower, is found face down in the surf, drowned.  The story underscores nature’s indifference and the comradeship of men facing death.
