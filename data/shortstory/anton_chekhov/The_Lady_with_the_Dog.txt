Anton Chekhov’s 1899 story "The Lady with the Dog" explores the quiet beginnings of an adulterous love affair and its disquieting consequences.  Dmitri Gurov is a bank officer from Moscow, dissatisfied with his marriage and prone to casual affairs.  While vacationing in the seaside resort of Yalta he notices a young woman walking a small Pomeranian.  He strikes up a conversation; she is Anna Sergeyevna, from a provincial town, also married and lonely.  They begin meeting daily, taking walks and drives; before the holiday is over they become lovers.  Both assume the fling will end when they return home, and after a bittersweet farewell on the pier they part.  Back in Moscow, however, Gurov finds he cannot forget Anna; her memory haunts his thoughts more persistently than any of his previous conquests.  On impulse he travels to Anna’s town under the pretext of business and surprises her at the opera.  Shocked and fearful, she nevertheless agrees to meet him, and their affair resumes in secret, now complicated by guilt and yearning.  Gurov realises that for the first time in his life he loves someone sincerely.  Over the following years the lovers sustain their relationship through clandestine trips to Moscow, where they meet in hotel rooms and stroll through the city.  They talk about their unhappiness with their respective marriages and their longing to build a life together, yet they can see no easy solution.  The story ends with them contemplating the difficult path ahead: their love has made them painfully aware of how trapped they are by social conventions, and they must decide whether they have the courage to change their lives.
