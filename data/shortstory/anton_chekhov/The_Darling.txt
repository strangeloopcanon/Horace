The Darling (Anton Chekhov, 1899)
Olga Semyonovna, known as "darling" for her affectionate nature, lacks opinions of her own and completely adopts the views of the men she loves.  She first marries Kukin, a theatre manager, and becomes absorbed in his worries about audiences.  After he dies, she marries Vasily Pustovalov, a timber merchant, and takes up his concerns about lumber.  When he dies, she takes comfort with a veterinarian, who is soon called away to war.  Olga is left alone and pines for someone to adore.  Years later she devotes herself to the son of her old lover, caring for him obsessively.  The child grows weary of her cloying love.  The story portrays Olga’s inability to exist independently and raises questions about identity and self‑sacrifice.
