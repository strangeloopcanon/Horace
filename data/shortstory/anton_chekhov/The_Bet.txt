The Bet (Anton Chekhov, 1889)
At a party, a wealthy banker and a young lawyer debate whether capital punishment is more humane than life imprisonment.  Impulsively the banker bets two million rubles that the lawyer cannot endure fifteen years of voluntary solitary confinement.  The young man accepts, agreeing to live alone in a lodge on the banker’s estate with no human contact.  In his cell the lawyer reads voraciously—languages, science, literature and philosophy—moving from frivolous novels to profound works.  Meanwhile the banker’s fortunes decline and he dreads having to pay the wager.  On the eve of the fifteenth year he resolves to kill the lawyer, but discovers a letter in which the lawyer renounces worldly riches as meaningless.  Intending to teach the banker a lesson, he escapes five hours before the deadline, thus forfeiting the bet but preserving his own dignity and the banker’s fortune.
