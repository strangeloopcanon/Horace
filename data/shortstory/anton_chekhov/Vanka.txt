Vanka (Anton Chekhov, 1886)
Nine‑year‑old Vanka Zhukov has been apprenticed to a Moscow shoemaker.  On Christmas Eve he sits by a dim lamp and writes a letter to his beloved grandfather Konstantin in the countryside, describing the cruelty he endures: beatings, hunger and endless work.  He begs to be taken home.  He lovingly recalls fishing with his grandfather and caring for the hunting dogs.  After finishing the letter he addresses it simply to "Grandfather in the village" and sneaks out to mail it.  Comforted, he curls up and falls asleep, dreaming of home.  The letter, poorly addressed, will never reach its destination, underscoring Vanka’s hopelessness and the plight of child laborers.
