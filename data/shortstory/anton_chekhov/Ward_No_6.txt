Ward No. 6 (Anton Chekhov, 1892)
In a provincial Russian town, the small hospital’s psychiatric ward—Ward No. 6—is neglected and brutal.  Dr. Andrey Yefimych Ragin is an indifferent physician more interested in philosophy than in curing patients.  He befriends Ivan Gromov, a former postmaster confined to the ward for paranoia, who argues that suffering cannot be justified by abstract theories.  Ragin, moved by Gromov’s reasoning, questions the complacency of society.  His reputation suffers and the hospital staff and townspeople denounce him.  After a series of misunderstandings and a stroke, Ragin himself is committed to Ward No. 6.  There he experiences the very neglect and cruelty he once ignored.  Unable to endure the squalor, he dies within days.  Chekhov’s story critiques institutional indifference and the intellectual’s detachment from reality.
