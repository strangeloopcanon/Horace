Gooseberries (Anton Chekhov, 1898)
Nikolai Ivanovitch, a clerk, sacrifices comfort for years to fulfil his dream of owning a small estate with gooseberry bushes.  His brother, the veterinary surgeon Ivan Ivanovitch, and their friend Burkin take shelter at a mill during a storm.  Ivan tells the story of Nikolai’s obsession.  After scrimping and marrying for money, Nikolai finally buys an estate and plants gooseberries.  Ivan visits and finds his brother complacent and proud, believing himself a landowner while peasants toil for him.  Tasting the sour gooseberries, Ivan feels that happiness founded on others’ misery is wrong.  He urges his listeners to seek meaning beyond personal comfort and to respond to human suffering.  The story criticizes self‑satisfied provincial life and questions the morality of happiness built on exploitation.
