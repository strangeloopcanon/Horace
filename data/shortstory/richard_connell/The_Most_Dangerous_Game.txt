Richard Connell’s 1924 thriller "The Most Dangerous Game" follows Sanger Rainsford, an American big‑game hunter, who falls overboard from his yacht while en route to South America.  He swims to the mysterious Ship‑Trap Island, whose reputation terrifies sailors.  There he finds an imposing chateau owned by General Zaroff, a Cossack aristocrat who also hunts but has grown bored with animals.  Zaroff reveals that he has devised a new sport: hunting shipwrecked sailors, whom he calls “the most dangerous game” because they can reason.  He offers Rainsford two choices: be hunted or face certain death by Ivan, his mute henchman.  Rainsford refuses to be complicit and becomes the prey.  Given a head start and a knife, he spends three days in the island’s dense jungle avoiding Zaroff.  He sets cunning traps: a Malay man‑catcher wounds the general, a Burmese tiger pit kills one of Zaroff’s hounds, and a Ugandan knife trap kills Ivan.  Nevertheless, Zaroff pursues him relentlessly.  Cornered at a cliff edge, Rainsford leaps into the sea and appears to perish.  That night Zaroff returns home to celebrate, only to find Rainsford hiding in his bedroom.  The hunter has become the hunted; the two duel offstage, and the story concludes with Rainsford sleeping peacefully in Zaroff’s bed, suggesting he has killed the general and triumphed over his perverse game.
