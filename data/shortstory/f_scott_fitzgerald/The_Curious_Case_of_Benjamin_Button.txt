The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1922)
In Baltimore in 1860, Roger and Hildegarde Button are shocked when their son Benjamin is born as a 70‑year‑old man with a long beard.  As Benjamin "grows" he becomes physically younger.  He marries a woman who eventually grows older than he looks.  He serves in the Spanish–American War while in his prime.  As time passes, Benjamin attends Harvard, reverts to childhood, and is cared for by his son.  Eventually he becomes a baby and fades from existence.  Fitzgerald’s satirical fantasy examines the absurdity of social conventions and the inexorable passage of time.
