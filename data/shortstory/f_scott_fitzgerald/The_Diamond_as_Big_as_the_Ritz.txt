The Diamond as Big as the Ritz (F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1922)
Mississippian John T. Unger attends a private school where he befriends Percy Washington.  Percy invites him to his family’s Montana estate, which sits atop a mountain made entirely of diamond.  The Washington family has guarded this secret for generations by killing or imprisoning anyone who stumbles upon it.  John is awed by their wealth and shocked by their ruthless methods, including enslaving captured aviators.  When authorities discover the mine, Percy’s father detonates explosives to prevent its seizure.  John escapes with Percy’s sister Kismine, who naively brings only a handful of gems.  As they watch the explosion destroy the mountain, Kismine laments that she forgot to bring even one jewel.  Fitzgerald’s satirical tale critiques the corrupting power of fabulous wealth.
