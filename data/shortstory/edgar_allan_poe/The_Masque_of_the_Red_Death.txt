The Masque of the Red Death (Edgar Allan Poe, 1842)
A gruesome plague called the Red Death ravages Prince Prospero’s realm.  The disease causes sharp pains, dizziness and bleeding, killing within minutes.  To escape the contagion, Prospero and a thousand courtiers retreat to a fortified abbey.  After months of seclusion, he hosts a lavish masquerade ball in seven color‑themed rooms, the last decorated in black and red with a giant ebony clock whose chimes halt the revelry.  At midnight a mysterious figure costumed as a victim of the Red Death appears.  Prospero angrily confronts the guest but falls dead.  One by one the revellers succumb.  When the last dies, the clock stops and darkness and decay hold dominion.  Poe’s allegory depicts the futility of trying to cheat death.
