The Fall of the House of Usher (Edgar Allan Poe, 1839)
The narrator travels to the gloomy mansion of his childhood friend Roderick Usher, who suffers from acute anxiety and a hypersensitivity to sound.  Usher’s twin sister Madeline is also ill with a mysterious malady.  The decaying house and its bleak surroundings mirror the siblings’ deteriorating minds.  After Madeline appears to die, the men entomb her in a vault beneath the house.  In the following days Usher becomes increasingly agitated, claiming to hear noises from the tomb.  During a stormy night the narrator reads to calm him, but their fears are realized when Madeline, still alive, bursts into the room and falls dead upon her brother.  With both Ushers gone, the narrator flees.  As he escapes he watches the mansion crumble and sink into the tarn, symbolizing the end of the Usher line.
