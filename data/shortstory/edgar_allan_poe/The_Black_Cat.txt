The Black Cat (Edgar Allan Poe, 1843)
A man recounts the events that led him to prison and the gallows.  As a child he loved animals, but as he grows older he becomes violent and an alcoholic.  He mistreats his pets and eventually hangs his faithful black cat, Pluto.  That night his house burns down and a curious image of a cat with a noose appears on a surviving wall.  He later acquires another cat resembling Pluto, except for a white patch on its chest.  Haunted by guilt and drink, he tries to kill the second cat but instead murders his wife with an axe.  He walls her body up in the cellar.  When the police search the house days later, the hidden corpse is exposed by a wailing sound: the cat he tried to kill had been entombed with the body.  The narrator’s crimes condemn him.
