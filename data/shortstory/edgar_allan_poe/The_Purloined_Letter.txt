The Purloined Letter (Edgar Allan Poe, 1844)
Parisian police prefect G– seeks help from the brilliant amateur detective C. Auguste Dupin.  A compromising letter has been stolen from a royal lady by the unscrupulous Minister D–, who hides it somewhere no search can reach, allowing him to blackmail her.  After thorough but fruitless searches of the minister’s apartment, G– offers a large reward if Dupin can recover the letter.  Dupin visits D– under the pretext of a friendly chat.  Noting the minister’s taste for disguise and cunning, Dupin suspects the letter is hidden in plain sight.  He spies a ragged letter-case hanging conspicuously in a card rack and deduces that the stolen letter has been slightly altered and placed there.  Dupin distracts the minister and swaps the purloined letter with a facsimile.  He later returns it to its rightful owner, earning the reward and humbling the police.
