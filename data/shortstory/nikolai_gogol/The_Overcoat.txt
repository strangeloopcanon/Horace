The Overcoat (Nikolai Gogol, 1842)
Akaky Akakievich Bashmachkin is a lowly copyist in St. Petersburg who is mocked by colleagues and lives a life of drudgery.  When his threadbare overcoat becomes unwearable, a tailor convinces him to order a new one.  Akaky scrimps and saves, finally obtaining a handsome, warm overcoat.  His coworkers admire it and his social standing briefly improves.  Returning from a party one night, he is robbed by thieves who take the coat.  Appeals to a "prominent personage" for help are met with bureaucratic indifference.  Akaky falls ill and dies of fever.  After his death, a ghost begins haunting the city, ripping off overcoats.  Eventually the apparition confronts the prominent personage, steals his cloak and disappears, symbolizing the dehumanizing effects of bureaucracy and poverty.
