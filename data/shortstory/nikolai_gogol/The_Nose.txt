The Nose (Nikolai Gogol, 1836)
Collegiate Assessor Kovalyov awakens one morning to find that his nose is missing.  Soon after, a high‑ranking official is seen parading around St. Petersburg, but it is actually Kovalyov’s nose in human form, dressed in uniform.  Kovalyov tries to confront his errant nose at the cathedral, but it rebuffs him, claiming to be of higher rank.  Desperate, Kovalyov advertises for the nose and appeals to the police.  After absurd bureaucratic interventions, the nose mysteriously reappears and reattaches itself.  Kovalyov returns to his routine, taking great care of his nose.  Gogol’s satirical tale mocks social pretensions and the capriciousness of status in imperial Russia.
