Eveline (James Joyce, 1914)
Eveline Hill, a young Dublin woman, gazes out her window thinking about leaving Ireland with her sailor lover, Frank.  She recalls her dead mother, her alcoholic father’s violence, and her own promise to keep the family together.  Tired of her monotonous job and domestic drudgery, she longs for escape but is also bound by duty and fear of the unknown.  On the night of departure she meets Frank at the docks.  As the ship’s whistle sounds, Eveline is paralyzed by panic and clings to the railing, unable to board.  Frank calls to her but she is unable to respond, feeling like a helpless animal.  He is forced to leave without her.  Eveline returns home, emotionless, trapped in the life she had hoped to flee.
