Araby (James Joyce, 1914)
In a drab Dublin neighborhood, a nameless boy lives with his aunt and uncle and harbors an intense but shy infatuation for Mangan’s sister.  He watches her from his window and imagines chivalric adventures.  One day she mentions the exotic Araby bazaar and laments that she cannot attend because of a retreat at her convent.  The boy eagerly promises to bring her a gift.  For days he is consumed by anticipation.  On the night of the bazaar his uncle returns home late and drunk, delaying him.  By the time the boy reaches the bazaar most stalls are closed.  In the dim light he listens to the trivial conversation of the remaining shopkeepers.  Realizing the vanity of his romantic dreams and the emptiness of the world around him, he leaves, his eyes burning with tears of humiliation.
