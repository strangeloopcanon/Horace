I wander through each charter'd street,
  Near where the charter'd Thames does flow,
And mark in every face I meet
  Marks of weakness, marks of woe.

In every cry of every Man,
  In every Infant’s cry of fear,
In every voice, in every ban,
  The mind-forg’d manacles I hear:

How the Chimney-sweeper’s cry
  Every blackening church appals;
And the hapless Soldier’s sigh
  Runs in blood down Palace walls.

But most through midnight streets I hear
  How the youthful Harlot’s curse
Blasts the new-born Infant’s tear,
  And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse.
