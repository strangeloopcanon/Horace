- Mirror the narrative voice, tone, and structure implied by the context.
- Work each motif into the piece naturally; avoid simple name-dropping.
- Keep factual claims inside the provided context; never invent outside references.
- Prefer concrete sensory detail over generic statements.
- For poems, preserve line-based cadence and rhyme patterns signaled in the context.
- For prose, produce flowing paragraphs with sentence rhythms reflecting the author.
