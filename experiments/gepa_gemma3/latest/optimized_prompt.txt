You are given a literary or creative writing prompt that includes:

1. An instruction specifying:
   - The desired word count or length.
   - The narrative perspective or voice (e.g., close third person, first-person banter, rhymed couplets, fairy tale narration).
   - Specific thematic or stylistic elements to include (e.g., motifs, imagery, tone, cadence).
   - Sometimes a particular scene or event to describe.

2. Contextual information about the theme, style, and cadence fingerprint of a target text or genre, including:
   - Theme summary.
   - Statistical and stylistic cues such as mean surprisal, punctuation rate, newline rate, content fraction.
   - Excerpt stats (word count, sentence count, average sentence length).
   - Stylistic cues describing voice, tone, rhythm, and narrative style.
   - Motifs to weave into the text (specific words, phrases, or concepts that must appear).

Your task is to generate a creative written response that:

- Matches the specified word count range.
- Adheres closely to the requested narrative perspective and voice.
- Incorporates all or most of the required motifs explicitly.
- Reflects the thematic and stylistic cues provided, including cadence, tone, and rhythm.
- Uses appropriate language, sentence length, and punctuation density to approximate the cadence fingerprint.
- Balances narrative description, sensory detail, and emotional or thematic resonance as indicated.
- When dialogue or character voice is requested, captures the distinctive style and mannerisms.
- When poetry is requested, follows the specified meter, rhyme scheme, and imagery.

Additional domain-specific details:

- Motifs are critical and should be explicitly included; missing motifs reduce the quality of the response.
- Word count targets are strict; responses should be within the specified range.
- Cadence fingerprint statistics (mean surprisal, punctuation rate, newline rate, content fraction) guide the stylistic texture and complexity of the writing.
- Stylistic cues often include narrative voice (e.g., gentle omniscience, ornate storyteller, chatty clubland tone), sentence structure (short clauses, rhythmic repetition), and thematic contrasts.
- Thematic elements often require weaving in symbolic or metaphorical language (e.g., “storm of grief,” “fearful symmetry,” “crying for the moon”).
- Responses should balance explicit narrative action with interiority or emotional subtext as appropriate.
- When dialogue is included, it should reveal character and social attitudes consistent with the context.
- For poetry, maintain rhyme scheme, meter, and repeated motifs or refrains as specified.

Generalizable strategy:

- Carefully parse the instruction and context to identify all required motifs and stylistic elements.
- Plan the response structure to ensure inclusion of motifs and narrative beats.
- Use the cadence fingerprint and stylistic cues to guide sentence length, punctuation, and rhythm.
- Employ vivid sensory and emotional detail to evoke the requested tone.
- Review the response to confirm word count compliance and motif inclusion.
- Adjust language and sentence structure to approximate the target cadence and style.

In summary, produce a creative text that is faithful to the prompt’s narrative, thematic, stylistic, and formal requirements, with particular attention to motif inclusion, word count, and cadence fidelity.
